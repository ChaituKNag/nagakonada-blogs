Whenever I talk to someone, my wife, a colleague, an old friend etc., I notice something strange.

## Firstly, the pleasantaries

It has been close to 20 months since I last wrote a blog post and I give my sincerest apologies to myself for waiting so long ðŸ¤ª.

Well, since I last wrote, I lot happened. I changed 2 companies, moved into a new own house and had a surgery. 

It has been a crazy ride for me, jumping through the hoops trying to get my house ready. This Covid-19 pandemic only made things worse in that front, what with workers evicting, builder giving up on the work and the interior designers making a mess of the wood-work, etc etc.

Things did not get easy with my health either, I gained weight as I completely stopped going for jogging, started eating junk food again. Finally it came down to me getting a bad stomach pain one fine morning and it turned out to be acute appendicitis for which I had to immediately undergo laproscopy surgery.

Things are slowly coming back to normal. I am finally settling in my new home, into which I moved in July 2020. But it is still scary in my place because the second wave of Covid-19 is way worse than the first one in India and the word around is that it is going to get even worser. So, if you are from around here, please take care of yourself and your family, my friend.

In the world of software development, every technology has a leading [library or framework](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/framework-vs-library). But have you ever wondered what is the leader among the leading libraries? Which technology has the highest number of likes or followers? Github is the best place to investigate and find out such a statistic. In this article, we will look at all the major technologies in various software development streams and explore the most popular libraries and frameworks in each category.

## Frontend Libraries

Frontend development is the process of using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create [web applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application) that run in a user's web browser. There are many popular frontend libraries available, but the clear leader is [React](https://react.dev/). React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook that allows developers to create complex and dynamic user interfaces. It has over **209k stars**  (2023) on Github, making it the most popular frontend library by a large margin.

Other popular frontend libraries include Vue.js, Angular, and Ember.js. [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) is a progressive JavaScript framework that is gaining popularity due to its simplicity and ease of use. Surprisingly, Vue.js has been more popular than React.js for a long time if you consider the GitHub stars parameter alone. [Angular](https://angular.io/) is a framework developed by Google that is widely used in enterprise applications. [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com/) is a framework that is known for its convention over configuration approach and is used by companies such as Netflix and LinkedIn.

## Backend Language Libraries

Backend development is the process of creating [server-side applications](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Introduction) that provide data and services to frontend applications. There are many programming languages that can be used for backend development, and each language has its own set of libraries and frameworks. The most popular backend language is currently Python, and it has a number of popular libraries such as Django and Flask. Although Node.js has the most stars among individual projects, we have to give this category to Python in this category. This is because of its collective stars in the first two popular libraries, among many others.

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. It has over 71.5k stars on Github and is used by companies such as Instagram and Mozilla. [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/) is a micro web framework that is lightweight and easy to use. It has over 63.3k stars (2023) on Github and is used by companies such as Airbnb and Netflix.

Other popular backend languages include Java, Ruby, and Node.js. [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) is a widely used programming language that is popular in enterprise applications. [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) is a dynamic, open-source programming language that is used in web development.

## Finally

In conclusion, the popularity of libraries and frameworks varies widely across different technologies and software development streams. However, by examining Github stars and usage by major companies, we can determine which libraries and frameworks are currently the most popular in each category. Although ChatGPT and AI are buzzwords in the software industry these days, it is important to note that a solid history of success and reliability for a tool is equally important. The number of stars on Github is a testament to this. React.js leads the way with **209k stars**, followed closely by Vue.js with 204k stars, and then TensorFlow with 176k stars.
